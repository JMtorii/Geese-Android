I still need to add better animations and tabs for the flock. 

Leo: 
Modify MainActivity.java and activity_main.xml for anything toolbar or navigation drawer-related. Add all your stuff into HomeFragment.java and fragment_home.xml for your custom listview. You'll probably need to create another xml view for the individual list cells. 

Michael:
Your stuff should be in FlockProfileFragment.java and fragment_flock_profile.xml. 

Johnny: 
Add a new item to the list in the DebugMainActivity.java so you can test your view page. I'll hook it up later. Create an activity and xml where appropriate.
