Useful Libraries
-----------------
Before implementing a new custom view or special features, please check out https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Must-Have-Libraries. This link has a lot of useful components, views, animations, and helper classes. Be careful of the libraries that haven't been updated in the past few months though.

Mark
------
I still need to do the following:
* add tabs to the flock sections 
* finalize colours and styles
* finalize font style
* add content to the settings page (sharing, rating, social media, help, contact us, rules and info, terms of service, and privacy policy)
* create text version of our Goose logo

Leo
-------
Modify MainActivity.java and activity_main.xml for anything toolbar or navigation drawer-related. Add all your stuff into HomeFragment.java and fragment_home.xml for your custom listview. You'll probably need to create another xml view for the individual list cells. 

Michael
--------
Your stuff should be in FlockProfileFragment.java and fragment_flock_profile.xml. 

Johnny
-------
Add a new item to the list in the DebugMainActivity.java so you can test your view page. I'll hook it up later. Create an activity and xml where appropriate.
